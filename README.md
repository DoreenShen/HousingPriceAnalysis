# HousingPriceAnalysis
This is a coding project I established by taking "the Introduction to Data Science by Python" course initialized by the University of Michigan. In this project, the hypothesis is that university towns have their mean housing prices less effected by recessions. Run a t-test to compare the ratio of the mean price of houses in university towns the quarter before the recession starts compared to the recession bottom. I needed to combine three datasets from different sources: housing data in the U.S. from Zillow research data site, a list of university towns in the U.S. from the Wikipedia page, and the GDP over time of the United States in current dollars (use the chained value in 2009 dollars) from Bureau of Economic Analysis, US Department of Commerce.
